        <h1>Ganesh Chaturthi</h1>
        <p>Ganesh Chaturthi is celebrated annually to mark the birth of Lord Ganesha, the God of new beginnings and a fresh start. The festival falls in the month of Bhadra, according to the Hindu calendar and in August/September according to the Gregorian calendar.</p>
        <p>Ganesha is the eldest son of Goddess Parvati and Lord Shiva. ... Once when Goddess Parvati went to take a bath, she took some turmeric paste and created a human form out of it. She then breathed life into this human form and thus a boy was born. Parvati accepted the boy as her son and asked him to guard the main gates.</p>
