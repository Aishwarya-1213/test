        <h1>Medaram Jatara</h1>
        <p>Sammakka Saralamma Jathara or Medaram Jathara is a tribal festival of honouring the goddesses celebrated in the state of Telangana, India. The Jatara begins at Medaram in Tadvai Mandal, Jayashankar Bhupalpally district.

            There are many legends about the miraculous powers of Sammakka. According to a tribal story, during 13th century, a troop from the Koya tribal community was returning from a trip when they saw a little girl playing with the tigers. The head of the troop saw the girl and inspired by her bravery, he adopted her and named her as Sammakka. Later she married a headman of a neighboring tribal group and had a daughter, Sarakka. Both the mother and daughter protested the Kakatiya kings who forced the tribes to pay taxes. Both the women fought bravely and reportedly lost their lives. The Koya community constructed this temple as a token of gratitude. Annually an event called Sammakka Saralamma jathara is held which is considered as one of the largest tribal festivals in the world</p>
